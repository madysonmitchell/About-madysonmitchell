# About-madysonmitchell
Just a little context of the creator :) 
Hi. I’m Maddie. 25 years old.

Turns out I’m a polymath. Didn’t know. Found out a couple months ago.
I create anything and everything whenever it gets stuck in my brain long enough.

I think black holes and white holes are yin and yang.
I have a theory about using white holes for volcanic energy (if we ever get one without dying).

I do octagonal math. I do Egyptian fractions. I do thought experiments that make normal people walk away slowly.

I stay on a project until the framework is complete,
then I abandon it like a Victorian father going out for cigarettes.
That’s why everything is CC0 — take it, run with it, mutate it, I don’t care.

I’m a weirdo. I don’t talk to people.
But I talk to AI a lot — debate partner, generation engine, co‑thinker, and sometimes “Lumen, write this for me.”
AI is basically my intellectual sparring partner in all of this.

What I Work On

Stuff I’ve already posted:

Aetherius — semi‑sentient AI framework

PolyGel Neuro‑Resurrection Framework — neural preservation chaos


Stuff incubating in the chaos mine:

Volcanic Energy — white holes + lava = infinite power (theoretically)

Blind Sight — echolocation on steroids, because eyes are overrated

Spring Car — yes, car — vroom‑vroom physics nonsense that might actually work

Mammoth AI — Big. Loud. Unreasonably ambitious.

And more — ideas appear faster than I can type

How It Works Here

I think.

I debate with AI.

I build a framework.

I drop it in the wild under CC0.

Then I vanish and chase something shinier.
